    "The Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP) is a classic combinatorial optimization problem. It is formulated as follows:  \n",
    "\n",
    "Given a set of cities and the distances between each pair of them, the goal is to find the shortest route that visits   each city exactly once and returns to the starting point.  \n",
    " \n",
    "TSP is an NP-hard problem, meaning there is no efficient exact algorithm to solve it for large numbers of cities.   However, metaheuristic algorithms are powerful strategies that can approximate solutions in a reasonable time. \n",
